Outline: In this project, you will simulate the Coloretto card game by Michael Schacht.
Coloretto is a card game played with a special deck of cards consisting of 77 cards. There are
four types of cards: 63 color cards (9 cards each in 7 colors), 10 “+2” cards, 3 joker cards, and
1 last round card (Figure 1). The goal of the game is to get as many cards in three colors. We
consider a 4-player game in this description.
Preparation: At the start of the game, take the last round card out, give each player 1 card in
different color, shuffle the deck, and put 15 cards face down as a deck. Then, put the last round
card on top of the deck as the 16th card. Lastly, put the remaining cards face down on the deck.
In addition to the deck, there are 4 rows of card. The rows start as empty.
